I chose the question "Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?" because it taps into the common social etiquette debates surrounding travel behavior, a topic that resonates with many people. Understanding public opinion on such matters can provide insights into societal norms and expectations.

What I found interesting about this dataset is the overwhelming consensus that moving to an unsold seat on a plane is not considered rude by the majority of respondents. This challenges the often-heard complaints about passengers' behavior and suggests a more relaxed attitude toward this specific action. 

The bar chart below illustrates the distribution of responses to the question. The data reveals that 80.7% of respondents believe it is not rude at all to move to an unsold seat, while 15.0% think it is somewhat rude, and only 4.3% consider it very rude. This visualization highlights the predominant view and the relatively small proportion of people who view this action negatively.
